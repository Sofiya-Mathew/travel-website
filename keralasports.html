                                    It may not sound appealing to anyone since a very competitive team of players plays
                                    the Mud football game in bogs or swamps. In the paddy fields, the players will be
                                    drenched in mud and splashing about. Typically played by the kids, whenever
                                    tournaments are held, the game attracts a very excited and applauding crowd.


                                    The game is usually played on flooded paddy fields. If you don't want mud splashing
                                    on your clothing then it's a good one. The enthusiasm and anticipation on the
                                    youngsters' faces make it clear that they have the time of the day.

                                    Seven Stones is a game steeped in Kerala's true culture and beauty. It's a game of
                                    amazing similarity to Lagori's game though. Seven stones are put in a row, and one
                                    of the team members must start the game by attempting to reach the stone stack.

                                    A participant has three chances of reaching the stack, and if it is ineffective, he
                                    will turn the ball off to the opposing team. A second-team member will attempt to
                                    catch the ball with rival team members. It's more like a ball of dodge. The majority
                                    of the leaders of the second team will concentrate on replacing the stack with the
                                    fallen stones.

                                    This traditional game, also known as the Boy and the Cane, is played in most
                                    villages and other rural regions of Kerala. It bears a noticeable resemblance to
                                    today's cricket.


                                    Kids playing the game, you need to play this game with a round stick and a peg
                                    chiseled at both ends. This peg is called the kutti, or the kid. A hole is rendered
                                    in a circle shape in the stone.
