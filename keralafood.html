                Cooking in Kerala is all about spices, aromas and textures. The cuisine is rather spicy and offers a
                large platter of opportunities for vegetarians as well as non-vegetarians. Generally, meat based dishes
                are all very spicy while vegetarian food is comparatively milder on the tongue. Keralan food is
                traditionally served on a clean green banana leaf and eaten with one's fingers. Coconuts grow all over
                the coastline of Kerala and consequently, coconut shells, grated coconut shavings and coconut milk are
                commonly used in dishes for thickening and flavoring. The long coastline, numerous rivers and inland
                tributaries have resulted in a strong fishing industry that supports the seafood obsession that most
                Keralites display. Boiled rice is a staple dish and is eaten with all sorts of gravies and curried
                accompaniments.

                One of the traditional Kerala dishes is vegetarian and is called the Kerala sadya. A full-course sadya,
                consists of rice with about 20 different accompaniments and desserts, and is the ceremonial meal of
                Kerala eaten usually on celebratory occasions including weddings, Onam and Vishu. It is served on a
                plantain leaf.

                Because of its rich trading heritage, over time, various indigenous Kerala dishes have been blended with
                foreign dishes to adapt them to local tastes. Coconuts grow in abundance in Kerala, so grated coconut
                and coconut milk are commonly used for thickening and flavouring.[4]

                Kerala's long coastline and numerous rivers have led to a strong fishing industry in the region, making
                seafood a common part of meals. Rice is grown in abundance along with tapioca. It is the main starch
                ingredient used in Kerala's food.[5]

                Having been a major production area of spices for thousands of years, the region makes frequent use of
                black pepper, cardamom, clove, ginger, and cinnamon. Kerala also has a variety of breakfast dishes like
                idli, dosa, appam, idiyappam, puttu, and pathiri.[6]
