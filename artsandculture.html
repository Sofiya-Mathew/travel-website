    <h1 class="text-center text-white bg-dark">Arts And culture</h1>
    <p class="text-center bg-dark text-white">Kerala has a rich tradition of art and culture with roots running deep
        into its colorful and vibrant past. The stone age carvings and pictorial writings at the Edakkal caves near
        Kalpetta, Wayanad bear testimony to this fact. Though the main religion practiced in the State is Hinduism, the
        influences of Christianity and Islam are distinct. Kerala has a rich tradition of harmony and peace with people
        belonging to different faiths and religions respecting each other and participating in all festivals, be it
        Onam, Vishu, Christmas or Id with equal fervor. The ensemble of all these religions has also caused an impact on
        its art forms as well.
        Graceful and exquisite dance forms like Kathakali, Mohiniyattam, Theyyam, Kol Kali, Oppana and Margam kali are
        well appreciated and enjoyed by everyone. The cuisine also reflects the influence of all communities, be it the
        spicy fish curries (Pearl Spot, locally called ‘karimeen’), boiled Kappa or Tapioca, Appams (lace pancakes),
        Puttu (steamed rice cakes), Idiyappam (string hoppers), Crab curries, Prawn dishes, all of which are prepared
        with the spices and condiments peculiar to Kerala.</p>

                <h3>kadhakali</h3>
                <p>The term Kathakali in Malayalam means “story-play”. This dance drama is said to be conceptualized
                    during
                    the seventeenth century. The elegant plays are based on the ancient stories of the Ramayana,
                    Mahabharata
                    and the Bhagavata Purana each depicting the Gods –heroes like Lord Rama and Lord Krishna. The
                    movements
                    in Kathakali are such that all the emotions like lust, greed, envy, and violence are shown
                    beautifully
                    giving great depth to the performance of the characters.</p>

                <h3>chakyarkoothu</h3>
                <p>Chakyarkoothu is one of the oldest classical arts of Kerala. A fine blend of social satire, mime, and
                    comedy, the Chakyarkoothu is usually presented in the traditional temple theatre Koothambalam or
                    Koothupura. This solo performance by the Chakkiar (a community name for Koothu performers) who dons
                    the
                    role of the Vidushaka (jester) is accompanied by the Mizhavu – (a percussion instrument) and
                    Ilathalam
                    (cymbals). The performance begins with an invocation to the presiding deity of the temple. The
                    narration
                    is enlivened with Thandava (the cosmic dance of Lord Siva) dance movements, gestures, and facial
                    expressions according to the 2nd century B.C treatise on theatre, Natyasastra written by Sage
                    Bharatha.
                    Through his inimitable narration of stories from the epics, the Chakkiar satirizes the manners and
                    customs of the time. No one is above the butt of his ridicule which varies from innocent mockery to
                    veiled innuendoes, barbed puns, and pungent invectives.</p>

                <h3>margamkali</h3>
                <p>Margam Kali is an art form found among the Syrian Christians in and around Kottayam, Kerala. In this performance, a dozen dancers sing and dance around a lighted wick lamp (Nilavilakku – a traditional Kerala lamp) clad in the simple traditional Christian women’s attire. This is an allegorical enactment with the lamp representing Christ and the performers as his disciples. The performance is usually held in two parts and begins with songs and dances narrating the life of St. Thomas, the apostle. The songs date back to a period much before the Portuguese invasion.</p>
